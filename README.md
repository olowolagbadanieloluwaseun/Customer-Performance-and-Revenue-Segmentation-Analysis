# Customer Performance & Revenue Segmentation Analysis  

## Overview  

This project focuses on understanding which customer segments truly drive revenue and how purchasing behavior influences overall performance. By analyzing customer demographics and transaction data, I identified clear patterns showing that revenue is concentrated within specific age groups and among customers with children, while repeat and high-frequency buyers contribute significantly more than occasional customers. I also implemented a dynamic ranking system to highlight top-performing customers, enabling easier identification of high-value segments. Overall, the analysis moves beyond basic reporting to provide clearer direction for targeted marketing, customer retention, and more informed business decision-making.

## The Problem  

The business had access to customer and transaction data, but lacked clarity on:

- Who the most valuable customers are  
- Whether revenue is evenly distributed or concentrated  
- How repeat purchasing behavior impacts overall performance  
- Which customer segments should be prioritized strategically  

Without structured segmentation, growth decisions risk being broad rather than targeted.

## Approach  

To address this, I:

- Calculated total customer count and average customer age to understand demographic distribution  
- Segmented customers into **VIP**, **Loyal**, and **Periodic Buyers** based on order frequency and purchase volume  
- Analyzed revenue across age groups, gender, and parental status  
- Implemented a dynamic ranking system to identify top-performing customers in real time  

The focus was to structure the analysis around decision-making, not just reporting.

## Key Insights  

- Revenue is highly concentrated among customers with children.  
- Customers aged 31–60 generate the majority of total revenue.  
- Repeat and high-frequency buyers contribute significantly more than occasional customers.  
- Revenue contribution across gender is nearly balanced, indicating purchasing behavior is a stronger driver than gender alone.  
- A relatively small segment of customers accounts for a disproportionately large share of revenue.

---

## Recommendations  

- Prioritize retention strategies for VIP and Loyal customers to protect revenue concentration.  
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns focused on high-performing age segments.  
- Create family-oriented product positioning or offers, given the strong revenue contribution from customers with children.  
- Continuously monitor top-customer ranking to manage dependency risks.  
- Shift marketing spend from broad outreach to behavior-based segmentation.
